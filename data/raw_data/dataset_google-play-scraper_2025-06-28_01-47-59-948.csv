Flightradar24 has a rapidly growing network of over 50,000 ground stations around the world to receive this data that then shows up as aircraft moving on a map in the app. In an expanding number of regions, with the help of multilateration, we’re able to calculate the positions of aircraft that don’t have ADS-B transponders. Coverage in North America is also supplemented by real-time radar data. Coverage is variable and subject to change at any time.<br><br><b>Connect with Flightradar24</b><br>We love getting feedback on FR24.
